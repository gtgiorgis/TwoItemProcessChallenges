Two Item Packaging Challenge
Introduction
	You have a budget for gifts, and you want to buy 2 gifts for your friend. You have decided to spend your
	entire budget, or at least as much as possible without going over.
	Your challenge is to select two different items from the list whose sum is less than or equal to your
	budget.
Assumptions
		You have an input file containing a list of gifts you are considering, sorted by price.
		The input file contains two columns per record,
		as shown to the right. Each record contains:
		1. A unique item identifier.
		2. A price for each item.
				Hat, 15.00
				Teddy Bear, 25.75
				Speaker, 59.99
				Neckless, 129.95
				Chair, 145.99
				Sports Equipment, 209.25
				Video Game System, 295.95
Write a program to find two items that consume most of your budget. The program should take two
inputs:
1. Your gift budget
2. A filename that contains a list of items sorted by price
The program's output should print the identifier and price for both items when a solution is found and
print "no solution" when unavailable.
Example Execution
		Prompt> findPair 200.00 giftList.txt
		Neckless, 129.95
		Speaker, 59.99
		Prompt> findPair 30.00 giftList.txt
		No solution
		Prompt> findPair 75.00 giftList.txt
		Speaker, 59.99
		Hat, 15.00
Questions
	1. What is the performance of the algorithm you implemented? Describe your answer using Big-O
	notation.
	2. How would you modify your solution to select three items? Additionally, how would you extend
	your solution to handle n items?
	3. Assume your algorithm must be able to process a list with billions of records. What additional
	considerations would affect your solution's design? What is the performance of the algorithm you implemented? Describe your answer using Big-O notation.
